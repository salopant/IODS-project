# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your github repository here. This is an R markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R markdown syntax. See the 'Useful links' page in the mooc area (chapter 1) for instructions.*

## Course aims

This course, Introduction to Open Data Science, will teach me how to utilize the open data in data science projects. I will learn how to scrap, wrangle and analyse the data and how to collaborate with other people using tools such as Github and R studio.

# Week 1 results

This week I have been able to install the R-studio and Git desktop tool. I already had my own Github account. I managed to fork the given Github repository and clone it on my own laptop. I have made some changes on the files cloned (with R-studio) and I also generated a public web page in github that will later be my learning diary (this document).

I learned some basic R - language and how to render the contents added on the R markdown file in the viewer. I had some trouble in getting the R-studio to render my work but I think it was because I did not have an R-studio project created at first.
