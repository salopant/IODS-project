# Week 3 results

This week I learned 

Wrangling: 

- how to join data from two dataframes by using values of several columns as keys in matching
- example: math_por <- inner_join(math,por,by=join_us,suffix=c(".math", ".por"))
- how to create new columns by calculating factors from existing columns
- example: cols <- select(alc,one_of(c("Dalc","Walc"))) *** alc["alc_use"] <- rowMeans(cols)

## Task

### Data wrangling part:
https://github.com/salopant/IODS-project/blob/master/data/create_alc.R

### Data analysis

#### Data described
Read first the data from the repository:
```{r}
alc <- read.csv("./data/alc_cons.csv")
str(alc)
```

Target is to study what might explain the alcohol consumption level of the respondents, with logistic regression.

I choose to make research on features: parent status (together/apart), number of failures in courses, romantice relationship (yes/no) and absense from school. My hypotheses is that parents not living together increase the amount consumption as does a higher number of absences and failures in previous classes in school. A romantic relationship probably protects from extensive alcohol use.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
vars <- c("Pstatus", "failures","romantic","absences","alc_use","high_use")
my_data <- select(alc,one_of(vars))
head(my_data)
```

Let us first have a look at the bar plots:

```{r}
library(tidyr); library(dplyr); library(ggplot2)

gather(my_data) %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + facet_wrap("key", scales = "free") + geom_bar()
```

Now, look at the cross tabulated data summaries to find out if the relations assumed as hypothesis could be true:

Parental status vs. alc use (mean)
```{r}
# produce summary statistics by group
my_data %>% group_by(Pstatus) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_use= mean(alc_use))
```

The data does not show clear relationship.The number of parents not living together is realtively small but more important, the students having both parents at home consume a bit more on average.

Number of failures in classes:
```{r}
my_data %>% group_by(failures) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_use= mean(alc_use))
```

This data hints that there could be a positive correlation between these features i.e. higher number of failures implicates higher alchol consumption

Romatic relationships:
```{r}
my_data %>% group_by(romantic) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_use= mean(alc_use))
```

Looks like my hypothesis is wrong again, data rather suggests that student in a relationship consume more alcohol

Absence from school (Less/More than 6 times):
```{r}
my_data %>% group_by(absences>6) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_use= mean(alc_use))
```
Here the hypothesis might be true i.e. absence might increase the consumption a bit

Next have a look at some box plots
```{r}
# initialise a plot of high_use and absences
g2 <- ggplot(my_data, aes(x = high_use, y = absences, col = Pstatus))

# define the plot as a boxplot and draw it
g2 + geom_boxplot() + ylab("absences") + ggtitle("Alcohol consumption and absence from school")
```
Being absent from school is more common with students that use more alcohol in both groups of parental status

```{r}

# initialise a plot of high_use and absences
g2 <- ggplot(my_data, aes(x = high_use, y = absences, col = romantic))

# define the plot as a boxplot and draw it
g2 + geom_boxplot() + ylab("absences") + ggtitle("Alcohol consumption and absences from school for students in/out of relationships")
```
Being absent from school is more common with students that use more alcohol also in both groups of romantic relationships

#### Logistic regression
Build logistic regression model between alcohol usage (high use) and the four explanatory features (parental status, failures, absence, romantic relations)
```{r}
m <- glm(high_use ~ failures + absences + romantic + Pstatus, data = my_data, family = "binomial")

# print out a summary of the model
summary(m)
```

The summary of the parameters show that both course failures and absence from school indeed correlate positively the alcohol consumption in risk level 5%. Romantic relationships however does not protect from alcohol consumption and neither does a static relationship of the parents.

Make a new model with only the two significant variables:

```{r}
m <- glm(high_use ~ failures + absences, data = my_data, family = "binomial")

# print out a summary of the model
summary(m)
# compute odds ratios (OR)
OR <- coef(m) %>% exp

# compute confidence intervals (CI)
CI <- confint(m) %>% exp

# print out the odds ratios with their confidence intervals
cbind(OR, CI)
```

Make a prediction:

```{r}
# predict() the probability of high_use
probabilities <- predict(m, type = "response")

# add the predicted probabilities to 'my_data'
my_data <- mutate(my_data, probability = probabilities)

# use the probabilities to make a prediction of high_use
my_data <- mutate(my_data, prediction = probability > 0.5)

# see the last ten original classes, predicted probabilities, and class predictions
select(my_data, failures, absences, high_use, probability, prediction) %>% tail(10)

# tabulate the target variable versus the predictions
table(high_use = my_data$high_use, prediction = my_data$prediction)
```
This confusion matrix above shows that the model is not very good in predicting high level use of alcohol. Only 15 cases of 114 are correctly predicted

Same thing graphically:
```{r}
# initialize a plot of 'high_use' versus 'probability' in 'alc'
g <- ggplot(my_data, aes(x = probability, y = high_use))

# define the geom as points and draw the plot
g + geom_point(aes(col = prediction))

# tabulate the target variable versus the predictions
table(high_use = my_data$high_use, prediction = my_data$prediction)%>% prop.table()%>%addmargins()
```
