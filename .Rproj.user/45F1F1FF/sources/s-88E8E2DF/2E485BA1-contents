## Data analysis

### Data wrangling
Link to data wrangling part (R script)
https://github.com/salopant/IODS-project/blob/master/data/human.R

### Data described 

The features in the data are

+ Country - Country name, id of the row 
+ Edu2F - Education rate of female    
+ LabFM - Labour force participation rate of both genders
+ LifeEx - Life expectancy at birth, years
+ ExpEduYrs - Expected years of schooling
+ GNI - Gross national income (GNI) per capita
+ MaternMortR - Maternal mortar rate
+ AdoBirthR - Births per 1000 women ages 15 - 19
+ PctReprParl - Women share of seats in parliament

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)

human <- read.csv("./data/human_mod.csv", row.names = 1)
# Access GGally
library(GGally)

# visualize the 'human_' variables
ggpairs(human)

```


From the pair plot we can see some obvious correlations. For example low maternal mortality correlates negatively life expectancy and adolescent birth rate AND positively GNI, female education rate and general education level. The intercorrelations of these variables are preserved cross wise. The ratio of females in parliament does not seem to correlate any of the other preserved variables.  

```{r}
# compute the correlation matrix and visualize it with corrplot
cor(human) %>% corrplot()
```

The correlation plot supports this view. Looks that all other variables are linked to each other except from general labour rate and the female representation in parliament.

### PCA

#### Non scaled data

Next perform principal component analysis on the data:
```{r}
# modified human is available
library(stats)

# print out summaries of the standardized variables
summary(human)

# perform principal component analysis (with the SVD method)
pca_human <- prcomp(human)

# draw a biplot of the principal component representation and the original variables
biplot(pca_human, choices = 1:2, cex = c(0.8, 1), col=c("grey40", "deeppink2"))
```

The biplot of the PCA does not seem to make much sense. The GNI is superor in scale and perfectly aligned in direction of the first PC. All other variables disappear in the mess and it is not possible to determine their magnitudes nor the directions. This is due to the range of GNI values reaching much higher (and lower in negative values) than other varibales and therefore it represents practically all variance in the data.

Now, perform the same PCA on *normalized* data
```{r}
# modified human is available
library(stats)
# standardize the variables
human_std <- scale(human)

# print out summaries of the standardized variables
summary(human_std)

# perform principal component analysis (with the SVD method)
pca_human_std <- prcomp(human_std)

# get the variances explained
s <- pca_human_std$sdev
pca_pr <- round(100*s, digits = 1)
# create object pc_lab to be used as axis labels
pc_lab <- paste0(names(pca_pr), " (", pca_pr, "%)")


# draw a biplot of the principal component representation and the original variables
biplot(pca_human_std, choices = 1:2, cex = c(0.8, 1), col = c("grey40", "deeppink2"), xlab = pc_lab[1], ylab = pc_lab[2])

text(-7,10,"Nordic countries",col = "red")
text(3,-10,"Middle East countries",col = "red")
text(7,6.5,"African countries",col = "red")

```

Now the biplot of the analysis shows that really all other variables than LabFM and PctReprParl are closely aligned in direction of the first principal component implying that they do correlate and that they also explain most of the variance in the data. On the other hand the two named variables are almost parallel with the second PC. This figure makes a lot of sense when interpreted with the correlation plot.

I can also recognize some clusters in the country data. The nordic countries seem to b epositioned pretty close to each other in the upper left corner suggesting that they are somewhat similar. A cluster of middle east countries can also be identified in the lower half of the plot and a group of African countries seem to be the only ones that stay in the upper right corner. 

### Multiple Correspondence Analysis

Perform the MCA on the data tea of dataset found in package "FactoMineR"

```{r}
# the tea dataset and packages FactoMineR, ggplot2, dplyr and tidyr are available
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(FactoMineR)
data(tea)

summary(tea)
str(tea)
```

The data obviously contains personal opinions collected from 300 persons regarding their habits/preferences/experiences about enjoying tea. 

From the 36 variables, I run the study on 6 selected variables named as

+ "Tea" - tea quality name
+ "How" - what prefer to add in tea, levels: alone, lemon, milk, other
+ "how" - how the tea should be packed (tea bag, unpackaged)
+ "sugar" - to add sugar or no
+ "where" - where to buy tea 
+ "lunch" - enjoy tea on lunch or not?

```{r}
# column names to keep in the dataset
keep_columns <- c("Tea", "How", "how", "sugar", "where", "lunch")
# select the 'keep_columns' to create a new dataset
tea_time <- dplyr::select(tea, one_of(keep_columns))

# look at the summaries and structure of the data
summary(tea_time)
str(tea_time)
```

MCA modeling

```{r}
# visualize the dataset
gather(tea_time) %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + facet_wrap("key", scales = "free") + geom_bar() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8))

# multiple correspondence analysis
mca <- MCA(tea_time, graph = FALSE)

# summary of the model
summary(mca)

# visualize MCA
plot(mca, invisible=c("ind"), habillage = "quali")

```

The MCA factor map implies that people that enjoy their tea as is (alone) tend to prefer not drinking tea with their lunch. Also people the prefer tea bags buy their tea from chain store and people who like unpackaged tea prefer shopping in a tea shop and further, people that like both, also do shopping in both kinds of shops.
