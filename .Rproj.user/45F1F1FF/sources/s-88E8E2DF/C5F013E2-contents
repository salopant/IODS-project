# Week 3 results

This week I learned 

Wrangling: 

- how to join data from two dataframes by using values of several columns as keys in matching

- example: math_por <- inner_join(math,por,by=join_us,suffix=c(".math", ".por"))

- how to create new columns by calculating factors from existing columns

- example: cols <- select(alc,one_of(c("Dalc","Walc"))) *** alc["alc_use"] <- rowMeans(cols)

- mutate dataframe: my_data <- mutate(my_data, prediction = probability > 0.5) 

Analysis: 

- Draw bar plots with ggplot + geom_bar
- create cross tabulated data summaries with group_by + summarise
- draw box plots with ggplot + geom_boxplot 
- build logistic regression model with glm()
- apply pipe as %>%
- compute odds ratios & confidence intervals with coef() %>% exp
- compute confidence interval with confint() %>% exp
- make predictions using the model as probabilities <- predict(m, type = "response")
- make confusion matrix with table as table(high_use = my_dataDOLhigh_use, prediction = my_dataDOLprediction)

### Data analysis

#### Data described
Read first the data from the repository:
```{r}
alc <- read.csv("./data/alc_cons.csv")
str(alc)
```

Target is to study what might explain the alcohol consumption level of the respondents, with logistic regression.

The explanations for the variables:

+ `school` -  student's school (binary: 'GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira)
+`sex` - student's sex (binary: 'F' - female or 'M' - male) 
+ `age` - student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22) 
+ `address` - student's home address type (binary: 'U' - urban or 'R' - rural) 
+ `famsize` - family size (binary: 'LE3' - less or equal to 3 or 'GT3' - greater than 3) 
+ `Pstatus` - parent's cohabitation status (binary: 'T' - living together or 'A' - apart) + `Medu` - mother's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 = 5th to 9th grade, 3 = secondary education or 4 = higher education) 
+ `Fedu` - father's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2  =  5th to 9th grade, 3 =  secondary education or 4 = higher education) 
+ `Mjob` - mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other') 
+ `Fjob` - father's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other') 
+ `reason` - reason to choose this school (nominal: close to 'home', school 'reputation', 'course' preference or 'other') 
+ `guardian` - student's guardian (nominal: 'mother', 'father' or 'other') 
+ `traveltime` - home to school travel time (numeric: 1 - <15 min., 2 - 15 to 30 min., 3 - 30 min. to 1 hour, or 4 - >1 hour) 
+ `studytime` - weekly study time (numeric: 1 - <2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - >10 hours) 
+ `failures` - number of past class failures (numeric: n if 1<=n<3, else 4) 
+ `schoolsup` - extra educational support (binary: yes or no) 
+ `famsup` - family educational support (binary: yes or no) 
+ `paid` - extra paid classes within the course subject (Math or Portuguese) (binary: yes or no) 
+ `activities` - extra-curricular activities (binary: yes or no) 
+ `nursery` - attended nursery school (binary: yes or no) 
+ `higher` - wants to take higher education (binary: yes or no) 
+ `internet` - Internet access at home (binary: yes or no) 
+ `romantic` - with a romantic relationship (binary: yes or no) 
+ `famrel` - quality of family relationships (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - excellent) 
+ `freetime` - free time after school (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
+ `goout` - going out with friends (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
+ `Dalc` - workday alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
+ `Walc` - weekend alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
+ `health` - current health status (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - very good) 
+ `absences` - number of school absences (numeric: from 0 to 93)

These grades are related with the course subject, Math or Portuguese: 

+ `G1` - first period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20) 
+ `G2` - second period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20) 
+ `G3` - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target)

I choose to make research on features: 

+ `parent status` (together/apart)
+ `number of failures` in courses
+ `romantic relationship` (yes/no) 
+ `absense from school` 

My hypotheses is that parents not living together increase the amount consumption as does a higher number of absences and failures in previous classes in school. A romantic relationship probably protects from extensive alcohol use.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
vars <- c("Pstatus", "failures","romantic","absences","alc_use","high_use")
my_data <- select(alc,one_of(vars))
head(my_data)
```

Let us first have a look at the bar plots:

```{r}
library(tidyr); library(dplyr); library(ggplot2)

gather(my_data) %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + facet_wrap("key", scales = "free") + geom_bar()
```

Now, look at the cross tabulated data summaries to find out if the relations assumed as hypothesis could be true:

Parental status vs. alc use (mean)
```{r}
# produce summary statistics by group
my_data %>% group_by(Pstatus) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_use= mean(alc_use))
```

The data does not show clear relationship.The number of parents not living together is realtively small but more important, the students having both parents at home consume a bit more on average.

Number of failures in classes:
```{r}
my_data %>% group_by(failures) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_use= mean(alc_use))
```

This data hints that there could be a positive correlation between these features i.e. higher number of failures implicates higher alchol consumption

Romatic relationships:
```{r}
my_data %>% group_by(romantic) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_use= mean(alc_use))
```

Looks like my hypothesis is wrong again, data rather suggests that student in a relationship consume more alcohol

Absence from school (Less/More than 6 times):
```{r}
my_data %>% group_by(absences>6) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_use= mean(alc_use))
```
Here the hypothesis might be true i.e. absence might increase the consumption a bit

Next have a look at some box plots
```{r}
# initialise a plot of high_use and absences
g2 <- ggplot(my_data, aes(x = high_use, y = absences, col = Pstatus))

# define the plot as a boxplot and draw it
g2 + geom_boxplot() + ylab("absences") + ggtitle("Alcohol consumption and absence from school")
```
Being absent from school is more common with students that use more alcohol in both groups of parental status

```{r}

# initialise a plot of high_use and absences
g2 <- ggplot(my_data, aes(x = high_use, y = absences, col = romantic))

# define the plot as a boxplot and draw it
g2 + geom_boxplot() + ylab("absences") + ggtitle("Alcohol consumption and absences from school for students in/out of relationships")
```
Being absent from school is more common with students that use more alcohol also in both groups of romantic relationships

#### Logistic regression
Build logistic regression model between alcohol usage (high use) and the four explanatory features (parental status, failures, absence, romantic relations)
```{r}
m <- glm(high_use ~ failures + absences + romantic + Pstatus, data = my_data, family = "binomial")

# print out a summary of the model
summary(m)
```

The summary of the parameters show that both course failures and absence from school indeed correlate positively the alcohol consumption in risk level 5%. Romantic relationships however does not protect from alcohol consumption and neither does a static relationship of the parents.

Make a new model with only the two significant variables:

```{r}
m <- glm(high_use ~ failures + absences, data = my_data, family = "binomial")

# print out a summary of the model
summary(m)
# compute odds ratios (OR)
OR <- coef(m) %>% exp

# compute confidence intervals (CI)
CI <- confint(m) %>% exp

# print out the odds ratios with their confidence intervals
cbind(OR, CI)
```

Make a prediction:

```{r}
# predict() the probability of high_use
probabilities <- predict(m, type = "response")

# add the predicted probabilities to 'my_data'
my_data <- mutate(my_data, probability = probabilities)

# use the probabilities to make a prediction of high_use
my_data <- mutate(my_data, prediction = probability > 0.5)

# see the last ten original classes, predicted probabilities, and class predictions
select(my_data, failures, absences, high_use, probability, prediction) %>% tail(10)

# tabulate the target variable versus the predictions
table(high_use = my_data$high_use, prediction = my_data$prediction)
```
This confusion matrix above shows that the model is not very good in predicting high level use of alcohol. Only 15 cases of 114 are correctly predicted

Same thing graphically:
```{r}
# initialize a plot of 'high_use' versus 'probability' in 'alc'
g <- ggplot(my_data, aes(x = probability, y = high_use))

# define the geom as points and draw the plot
g + geom_point(aes(col = prediction))

# tabulate the target variable versus the predictions
table(high_use = my_data$high_use, prediction = my_data$prediction)%>% prop.table()%>%addmargins()
```
